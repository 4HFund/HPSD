    <h1>Final Hammond PSD Audit Findings</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Audits Confirm a Broken Financial System</h2>
        <p>Hammond PSD has no general ledger, no chart of accounts, and doesn't perform regular bank reconciliations. Their finances are pieced together from bank statements, not internal records—making any form of oversight nearly impossible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Legally Required Cash Reserves Were Ignored</h2>
        <p>The district was short by $23,620 in its required cash reserve in 2023 under WV law (SB234). This means they were out of compliance while simultaneously raising rates and claiming financial hardship.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Vehicles and Equipment Misused or Untracked</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vehicles were purchased using public funds with no usage tracking policy.</li>
            <li>Employees were allowed to take vehicles home without mileage logs.</li>
            <li>One vehicle (a side-by-side) was such a poor purchase it required legal involvement to try and return it.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Meeting Minutes Tampered With or Lost</h2>
        <p>Official board meeting minutes were “lost” and later rewritten with less detail. Financial decisions were approved without documentation or public discussion. This is not poor recordkeeping—it’s strategic obfuscation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Executive Sessions Misused</h2>
        <p>Key decisions involving staff pay, vehicle use, and grant oversight were discussed in executive session—shielded from the public. The same staff member, Holly Stewart, appears at the center of nearly every internal decision with no checks on her authority.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Hammond PSD is not just mismanaged—it is functionally lawless. Oversight has been evaded, public funds redirected for internal benefit, and accountability actively suppressed. State intervention is no longer optional—it's overdue.
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Next Steps:</strong> This report will be delivered to the West Virginia State Auditor, the Public Service Commission, and ethics investigators. A petition will also be circulated calling for merger talks to be reopened and for full external oversight of Hammond PSD.

    <h1>Hammond PSD Water System Failures</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Massive Water Loss</h2>
        <p>Hammond PSD loses over <strong>1.8 million gallons per month</strong>—about <strong>30% of all water pumped</strong>. This translates to tens of thousands of dollars in waste every year with no meaningful system upgrades to show for it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Chronic Leaks and Breaks</h2>
        <p>The system averaged <strong>35–40 leaks and 4–5 major line breaks per year</strong>. These figures reflect ongoing infrastructure failure with little preventative action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Serious Health Violations</h2>
        <p>Hammond PSD received <strong>two Tier 1 violations</strong> in both 2022 and 2023—meaning urgent public health threats like bacterial contamination or system pressure loss that require 24-hour public notice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Maintenance Failures</h2>
        <p>In 2024, the district logged 240 hours of emergency maintenance and only 65 hours of preventative maintenance—showing they spend nearly 4x more time reacting than preventing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Water Advisories and Contamination Risk</h2>
        <p>Emergency planning documents outline scenarios where residents must boil water, avoid drinking it, or even <strong>avoid bathing or touching it</strong>. Several real events have triggered these warnings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. SCADA System Still Missing</h2>
        <p>Since 2019, Hammond PSD has claimed to be installing automated leak and pressure detection systems (SCADA). But <strong>no audit, budget, or board report shows the system was ever completed</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Minimal Reservoir Capacity & Pressure Drops</h2>
        <p>The system’s main reservoir holds only 0.12 million gallons—too little for sustained outages—and some zones experience <strong>dangerous pressure drops</strong> that allow contamination to enter the system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Hammond PSD’s water infrastructure is failing. Water is leaking, pressure is dropping, health risks are real—and the money meant to fix it is going elsewhere. Ratepayers deserve better.

    <h1>Hammond PSD Board Corruption & Misconduct</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Insider Dealings and Nepotism</h2>
        <p>The board approved the sale of a district-owned solar panel directly to the board chair’s husband without a sealed bid or public auction. This is a clear violation of public trust and procurement ethics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Board Decisions Made in “Special Sessions”</h2>
        <p>Major decisions—including financial approvals and personnel matters—were often made in special or emergency sessions with limited attendance and poor documentation, undermining transparency and accountability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Payroll & Bonus System Benefiting Insiders</h2>
        <p>The board approved and perpetuated a system of internal bonuses—sick leave incentives, insurance opt-outs, and longevity pay—that disproportionately benefit staff and board-connected employees with little to no public oversight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Merger Killed to Preserve Pay & Benefits</h2>
        <p>A planned merger with Brooke County PSD was reversed after internal staff raised concerns about losing insurance and pay. Documents suggest this decision was driven more by protecting administrative positions than serving the public.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Failure to Enforce Ethics and Disclosures</h2>
        <p>No board member disclosures or ethics compliance records have been provided despite multiple conflicts of interest. This indicates a systemic failure to enforce even the most basic standards of public service ethics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Suppression of Public Records</h2>
        <p>Key board meeting minutes were “lost” and later rewritten. This raises serious concerns about tampering with official records and hiding board activity from public view.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The board has repeatedly acted in self-interest—shielding themselves from scrutiny, rewarding insiders, and using public money to maintain personal power and perks. Ratepayers are left with higher bills, worse service, and no transparency.

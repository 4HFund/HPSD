    <h1>The Hammond PSD Merger That Should Have Happened</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What Was the Merger?</h2>
        <p>In 2017, Hammond PSD agreed to merge with Brooke County PSD—a move designed to reduce administrative costs, improve water infrastructure, and stabilize rates. The merger promised better service, stronger oversight, and a more professional utility system for local ratepayers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why Was It Killed?</h2>
        <p>Despite an initial agreement, the board reversed course and withdrew from the merger. Why? Because the merger would have placed Hammond PSD employees under Brooke County PSD’s structured compensation system—meaning some staff and administrators would lose their inflated pay and insurance perks.</p>
        <p>Rather than serving the public, the board chose to protect their own interests.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What’s Happened Since Then?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple rate increases</li>
            <li>Over 30% water loss every year</li>
            <li>Administrative bonuses and staff expansion</li>
            <li>Audit failures and unaccounted grants</li>
            <li>No completed SCADA or infrastructure upgrades</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The problems the merger would have addressed have only gotten worse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why the Merger Should Be Back on the Table</h2>
        <p>Bringing back the merger would allow Hammond PSD to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eliminate redundant administrative spending</li>
            <li>Adopt professional accounting and oversight systems</li>
            <li>Partner on infrastructure and grant projects</li>
            <li>Restore transparency and public trust</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Call to Action:</strong> Demand that the Brooke County Commission and the WV Public Service Commission reopen discussions about the merger. Ratepayers deserve a system that works for them—not just the people running it.
